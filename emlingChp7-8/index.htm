	<p class="text">Glacial Lake Maumee was a proglacial lake that was an ancestor of present-day Lake Erie. It formed about 14,000 years ago. As the Erie Lobe of the Wisconsin Glacier retreated at the end of the last ice age, 
	it left meltwater in a previously existing depressional area that was the valley of an eastward-flowing river known as the Erigan River that probably emptied into the Atlantic Ocean following the route of today's 
	Saint Lawrence River. Some geologists think that the Erigan could have been a downstream segment of the preglacial Teays River system. The glaciers destroyed or disturbed most of the preglacial drainage patterns and enlarged 
	and deepened the Erigan basin.
	<br> 
	<br>
	Lake Maumee is the first of a series glacial lake, which occupied the Huron-Erie basin. It was preceded by a few small, disconnected lakes which lay between the ice margin and the southern divide of Erie basin. The outlet past 
	Fort Wayne was the lowest point on the border at the beginning of the lake's existence. Later, a northerly outlet was reached near Imlay, Michigan. The lake had two outlets for a short time. With the retreat of the ice barrier on the north, 
	a lower outlet was found, ending the history of Lake Maumee and beginning the Lake Whittlesey era. The name Lake Maumee was first applied in 1888 G. R. Dryer, of the Indiana Geological Survey, 
	in an official report on the Geology of Allen County, Indiana.</p>

	<p class="text2">As the Erie Lobe retreated to the northeast, it left large debris deposits called moraines running at right angles to its line of retreat. One of these, called the Fort Wayne Moraine, was left at the site of present-day 
	Fort Wayne, Indiana, where it acted as a dam that held back the waters of the lake. When the water was at its highest point, about 800 feet above sea level ( ), it left beach ridges that later became the routes of trails and highways. 
	During this stage, the waters of the lake, possibly in response to an advance of the ice front at the lake's eastern end, overtopped a "sag" in the Fort Wayne Moraine. This caused a catastrophic drainage of the lake known as the Maumee 
	Torrent that scoured a one- to two-mile-wide outlet running southwest to the Wabash River known as the Wabash-Erie Channel.

	<br>
	As the Erie Lobe of the Laurentian glacier melted towards the northeast, it left a series of moraine across Indiana Ohio, and Michigan. The Fort Wayne Moraine through Fort Wayne, Indiana formed the western boundary of a meltwater lake. 
	The lake crested this barrier at 800 feet above sea level, creating a stable lake for a period of time, which left beach ridges that is still visible. Later this gap in the ridge of the moraine became a pathway for animals and humans to 
	traverse area and later, for trails and highways. During this stage, the waters of the lake, possibly in response to an advance of the ice front at the lake's eastern end, overtopped a "sag" in the Fort Wayne Moraine. This caused a catastrophic 
	drainage of the lake known as the Maumee Torrent that scoured a one- to two-mile-wide outlet running southwest to the Wabash River known as the Wabash-Erie Channel.</p>

	<p class="outlets">Outlets</p>
	
	<p class="text2">Lake Maumee was the first large lake formed as the ice border shrank into the Erie-Maumee basin. The outlet of the lake was at Fort Wayne, Indiana, was across the lowest place on the border of the basin. Its altitude seems 
	to have been at first about 785 feet, or 212 feet above Lake Erie, but during its life as an outlet, reduced to 760 feet. At its highest point, the lake used this single outlet. By the time, the lake levels reached the 
	location of the Imlay outlet on the "Thumb," of Michigan, the Fort Wayne outlet was much lower than at the beginning and a lower lake level became established. The highest beach is 785 feet to 790 feet, near the Fort Wayne 
	outlet, In Michigan its about 800 feet with areas in Lapeer county its nearly 850 feet.
	<br>
	<br>
	The Imlay outlet is 805 feet to 810 feet above sea level or 50 feet above the bed of the Fort Wayne outlet. The Imlay outlet opened into a small lake east and south of Flint. This lake extended to Swartz Creek. 
	Thence west to a stream across Shiawassee and Clinton counties to the Grand River northwest of St. Johns. The highest beach is very irregular. The first or highest beach exposure to wave action that the other beaches do not reflect. 
	The second beach is more regular, and on the whole somewhat stronger than the highest. There is a third beach, which is generally weak and in places difficult to trace. The third beach connects with well-defined deltas 
	which the higher levels do not have. 
	<br>
	<br>
	They most notable are at the Raisin and the Huron rivers. The third beach is 20 feet below the Imlay outlet. The outlet at that time may be across the "Thumb" in a lower passage a few miles north. 
	The readvance of the ice sheet may have closed this outlet with a moraine closely bordering the Imlay outlet. The lake beaches, because of their sandy or gravelly constitution, form better lines for 
	highways than neighboring clayey tracts. Thus, early roads followed these natural routes along the lakes. The move to building roads on north and south and east and west lines has led to the abandonment of all or 
	part of these 'beach' roads.</p>
