	<p class="retreat">The Lake Retreats in Stages</p>
	
	<p class="text2">Two later stages of Lake Maumee, (called the "Lowest" and the "Middle," in that order) had lower water levels because 
	the retreating ice exposed an outlet lower than the Wabash-Erie Channel. The Lowest Maumee (elevation: 
	about 760 ft) drained westward through the Grand River in Michigan and into Glacial Lake Chicago, an 
	ancestor of present-day Lake Michigan. Another advance of the ice blocked that outlet, raising the lake 
	level to about 780 feet, the stage known as the Middle Maumee. A new outlet called the "Imlay Outlet" 
	formed that connected with an unobstructed segment of the Grand River farther west. There is enough 
	uncertainty about this sequence that some authorities think that Middle Maumee might have preceded 
	Lowest Maumee.</p>
	<p class="text2">Fluctuations in water level continued through more stages (Akrona, 695 feet; Whittlesey, 
	738 feet; Warren and Wayne, 660-685 feet; and Lundy, 590-640 feet. This see-saw pattern continued until an 
	eastern outlet opened at Niagara, establishing the drainage pattern of modern Lake Erie (569 feet). 
	This involved the reversal of drainage in what is now northeastern Indiana and northwestern Ohio as the 
	Maumee River outlet developed by capturing streams that formerly drained into the Wabash. The Great Black 
	Swamp that once occupied much of the land between Sandusky, Ohio, and New Haven, Indiana, was a remnant of 
	the bed of Glacial Lake Maumee. Geologists call the former lake bottom the Maumee Lacustrine Plain.</p>

	<p class="beach">Highest Beach</p>

	<p class="text2">The altitude of the highest Maumee beach is 775 to 780 feet at the head of the outlet in the vicinity of 
	Fort Wayne and New Haven, Ind. To the northeast, 50 to 75 miles, along the Ohio and Michigan state line, it 
	is 20 to 25 feet higher. In West Unity and Fayette, Ohio, the beach is at 801 and 798 feet. The strong beach 
	is generally above 800 feet and at a few points rises to 810 and 812 feet. On the south side of Lake Maumee .
	the highest beach 775 and 785 feet from Fort Wayne to Cleveland. The maps show it to be 810 and 812 feet 
	from Delphos to Findlay.</p>
